Technologies: -

Our tour booking platform is built using modern web technologies to ensure scalability, reliability, and a smooth user experience.

Frontend: We utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, ensuring a responsive and interactive user interface.

Backend: The backend of our platform is powered by a robust server-side technology stack. We use Node.js as the runtime environment along with Express.js as the web application framework for building APIs and handling server-side logic. For data storage, we employ databases like MongoDB to store user information, tour details, bookings, and reviews.

Authentication: User authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and stateless authentication. This ensures that users can securely log in and access their accounts.

APIs: We design RESTful APIs to handle communication between the frontend and backend, facilitating seamless data exchange. These APIs allow users to retrieve tour information, make bookings, and submit reviews.

Database: Our platform utilizes NoSQL database to store and manage data efficiently.
